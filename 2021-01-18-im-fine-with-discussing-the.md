@jonn@social.doma.dev I’m fine with discussing the technical implications of a change like this, but the responses to the change were mostly “the old name wasn’t intended badly”, “I don’t see the problem” and “this won’t fix anything”.

I’m quite sure none actually have a local Rails checkout, or are in any way affected by this technically.
