Aside from this being a very useful plugin, this was a test project to learn how to build rebar3 plugins. However, using the generator I overlooked would have done most of the work (aside from the flamingo). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    $ rebar3 new plugin rebar3_flamingo

One thing I did figure out that might be useful in lieu of the guide I planned to write: to test a rebar3 plugin, add it to its own `project_plugins`, then symlink `_checkouts/rebar3_flamingo` back to `..`.

Now you can call `rebar3 flamingo` from its own project root.
