@citizen428@chaos.social I’ve had projects where I had to update the initial commit after already branching out, especially when I build descriptive example projects with descriptions in their commit messages, like [this one](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/hayago), for example.

If you’re fine with adding another commit, that’s not an issue. However, that wasn’t really an option in this case, because that would break the step-by-step descriptions.
