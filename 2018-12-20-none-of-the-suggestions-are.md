@nvie@twitter.com None of the suggestions are too basic. I'm specifically looking for tips that go easily unnoticed (like `o` in a visual selection), because they have the biggest chance of sticking and being useful. Thanks for reminding me of `⌃a` and `⌃x` (I always forget), and `g ⌃a` is amazing!
