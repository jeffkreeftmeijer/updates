Don't worry, I’m a neovim user myself. ✊

I’m actually the other way around in regards to neovim’s `:terminal`, though. I *am* using tmux, and prefer splitting the tmux window instead of starting a terminal session in Vim.

I must say I’ve never taken the time to set `:terminal` up properly, as I’m still getting a couple of “command not found” errors when starting it.

Fun fact: I’ve actually tried using tmux splits instead of Vim’s built-in ones a while back, but that didn’t really work because I didn’t find a way to share sessions between Vim instances.

So, what does your workflow look like? Do you open up Vim and do everything from there, in one instance?
