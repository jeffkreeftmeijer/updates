@chastell@twitter.com Thatâ€™s the other option Iâ€™m trying. Set it up with [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) last night, and it seems to work so far. I mostly get in trouble when exiting insert mode and immediately saving, but that should be fixed by tweaking the delay.

Speaking of saving files, that should probably also be fixed by auto-saving when leaving insert mode, like we talked about a while back. ðŸ¤”
