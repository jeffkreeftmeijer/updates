I use [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) to switch between Vim and tmux splits, configure Vim to use the unnamed paste buffer, and use [reattach-to-user-namespace](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard) to do the same in tmux (although that [doesn’t seem to be required anymore](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/issues/66)).

I’ll try the built-in terminal again sometime soon, though!
