@scottradcliff@twitter.com I set up <https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect> and <https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum> to solve that problem, but found out it hadn’t worked after rebooting a while back. 

Not sure what’s wrong, and I don’t want to reboot to test and lose all of my sessions again. 🤷‍♀️
