@vindia@twitter.com @aksie@twitter.com I, for one, like my single-team Slack experience so far. Mentions in other teams arrive in my inbox after a while, so I keep track of one team, which is more than enough.

Accidentally added the wrong H&F team, however, so I'm in the same boat. Do share if you find that .plist!
