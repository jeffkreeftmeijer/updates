@emjii@twitter.com @hubertlepicki@twitter.com @smeevil@twitter.com Yes, that's what I thought. The either-dependencies (however they'd be implemented) would be a nice-to-have for us, as we wouldn't be able to use them right now for backward compatibility reasons. Thanks for having us pick your brain on this. :)
