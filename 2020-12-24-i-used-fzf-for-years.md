@schnittchen@mastodon.social I used fzf for years, but I haven’t really missed it after removing it a while back. It was convenient enough that I forgot about my ctags, which seem like a quicker way to move around.

In the interest of keeping my configuration as minimal as I can, I’ll double down on ctags for now, to see if that speeds things up a bit without having to manage an extra plugin.

What’s your setup like? :)
