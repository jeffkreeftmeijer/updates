In a patch I failed to merge for more than half a year, @bubuntux@twitter.com fixed [a bug in vim-numbertoggle that has been there since its inception](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle/pull/50).

2.1.2 should prevent switching to relative numbers in insert mode when the window regains focus. Thanks Julio!
