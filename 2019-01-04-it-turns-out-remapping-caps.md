It turns out remapping Caps Lock to Esc is apparently not the thing people do anymore. It’s Control again. As always; ignoring trends for long enough will make them go away.

So, I’ll also try remapping Caps Lock to Control, but actually using it this time. Since Control + [ can be used as Escape, that’d result in having Caps Lock as Control, and Caps Lock + [ as Escape.
