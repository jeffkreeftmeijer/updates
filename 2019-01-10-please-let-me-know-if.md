@scottradcliff@twitter.com Please let me know if you try it out! I’m planning on adding more adapters, as I’ve been adding updates to Reddit, Dev.to and Pixelfed to my archive repository manually.

About posting to your personal site, I’ve set up <https://updates.jeffkreeftmeijer.com> to publish all updates from the repository. Is that what you mean, or would you like to use Dolphin to post articles to your blog, for example?
