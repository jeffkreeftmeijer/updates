@chastell@twitter.com Exactly the kind of tips I'm looking for, thanks! I have `:wq` and `:q!` in my muscle memory, but I'll be sure to try these.

I've been meaning to auto-save for a while too but I'd like to *always* save (like on `InsertLeave` too), so I don't need to worry about saving myself.
