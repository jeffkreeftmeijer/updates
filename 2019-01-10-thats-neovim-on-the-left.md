![A screenshot showing NeoVim and a git diff in tmux, colored with appsignal.terminal's dark version.](/media/appsignal-dark.png)

That’s NeoVim on the left and git on the right in tmux. I use Apple’s Terminal.app, and an [updated version of Vim’s default colorscheme](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim), combined with a [terminal theme to set colors](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/appsignal.terminal) throughout the whole terminal. I wrote [an article about my 16-color setup](https://dev.to/jkreeftmeijer/consistent-terminal-colors-with-16-ansi-color-vim-themes-32a1) a while back, if you’d like to learn more.
