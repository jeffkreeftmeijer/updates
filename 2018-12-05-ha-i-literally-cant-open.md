@artieleach@mastodon.social ha, I literally can't open, edit and save a file in Nano.

My whole setup is basically tmux in a terminal with Vim as my editor. tmux allows for windows and tabs to be able to keep projects and files separate.

Used Atom for a bit, too, by the way. Loved its plugins and actually-sane defaults.
