Alright, naming things. A test has states, like “passed”, “failed” and “skipped”. What’s should the state before the test is run be called? Any suggestions?

Right now, “upcoming” is the best I can come up with. Or “pending”, but that’s used by libraries like RSpec to describe skipped tests, so using that could be confusing.
