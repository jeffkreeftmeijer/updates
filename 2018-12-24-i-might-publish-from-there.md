@mvz@mastodon.social I might publish from there through ActivityPub eventually.

I didn't start my own instance because I didn't want to have to keep it running. Right now, all updates are in a git repository, and that page is statically generated. Also, I'd like to post updates that only get syndicated to a single place, and not necessary to Mastodon (like Reddit, for example).
