Vim has a gatekeeping problem.

I’ve been told using MacVim wasn’t the way, moving using the arrow keys was bad, that using a pre-made plugin setup was dumb. Enthusiastic articles about my setup have been roasted on the internet.

I’ve been part of the problem. I’ve told people not to bother because it’s quicker to learn any other editor. That’s not nice, and it misses the point.

If you have a thing for arcane software, Vim might be your thing. Tinkering with it, uncovering its secrets, and understanding its weirdness is some of the most fun I had on a computer.

I’d say give it a shot, and let me know if I can help.
