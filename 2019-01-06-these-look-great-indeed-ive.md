@timriley@mastodon.social These look great indeed. I’ve been using [Hocus Focus](http://hocusfoc.us) to hide everything aside from the current window, and use splits in my full screen terminal, so never had much use for Divvy.

Replacing tools like that with scriptable versions sounds great, and I’d love to have them all in one place. Hammerspoon sounds great for that indeed, I’ll be sure to try it out. Thanks!
