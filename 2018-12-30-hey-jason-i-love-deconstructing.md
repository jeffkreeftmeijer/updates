@skryking@ruby.social Hey Jason! ðŸ‘‹

I love deconstructing software to learn how it works under the hood. I've written about programming Ruby for years, but picked up writing about Elixir in the last half year as well. At AppSignal, I split my time between working on their integration libraries and writing for their Elixir and Ruby newsletters.

Most of what I've written is published or linked to on <https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com>. 

What are you up to? :)
