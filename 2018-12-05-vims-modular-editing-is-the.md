@artieleach@mastodon.social Vim's modular editing is the quickest way to edit and move around files I've used, and I prefer doing all development work in the terminal.

But yes, we're mostly pretending. That message was Vimspeak for "you can use % to jump between brackets". I might have overdone it with the backticks. ðŸ˜¬

So, what's your favorite editor?
