Here’s a first for me: apparently, somebody is offering a “cracked” version of my six-year-old Apple TV app on their website, with my name on it. 

Don’t download that. I have no idea what it is.

My project is open source with a permissive license (like everything I do unless I’m forced to do otherwise), available on Github, currently unbuildable, and superseded by an official (also free) version built by the developers of the API mine is consuming. 

In general; all of my code is available at https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer?tab=repositories (here be dragons). If you’re unsure about licensing, reach out and I’ll fix that.

If you ever find any of my code or writing republished somewhere, let me know so I can do something about it.
