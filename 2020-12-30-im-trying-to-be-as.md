@izelnakri@twitter.com I’m trying to be [as minimal as possible](https://twitter.com/jkreeftmeijer/status/1341386114372919297) to avoid issues with key bindings and package management, and I [don’t bother with Vim’s color schemes](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/vim-16-color/). That seems to solve most of these.

For coc, since its plugins are implemented in Node, they need to be installed through npm, requiring an extra step, which makes sense technically at least. I’ll write something about my approach when I find the time.

Emacs is wonderful, from what I’ve seen of it. I never properly dove in, though. Maybe one day. For now, I consider tinkering with Vim’s configuration a fun pastime.
