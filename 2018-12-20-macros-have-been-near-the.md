Macros have been near the top of the list Iâ€™ve been planning to properly figure out for years now, I just never get around to it. I always have a hard time blindly recording macros with `q<letter><commands>q`.

I love the idea of writing macros in command mode, and having them available in the command history. That article looks great, too. Great suggestion!
