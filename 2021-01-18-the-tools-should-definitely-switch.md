@jonn@social.doma.dev The tools should definitely switch to a better default.

That said, there’s no reason not to be ahead of the curve switching to the new name for any new projects, and asking your users to switch branches in their local checkouts isn’t a big deal either.

It’s certainly no reason for a backlash like we’ve seen after Rails switched last week. 🤷‍♂️
