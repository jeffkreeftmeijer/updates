@oz@ruby.social Thatâ€™s a great tip, thanks! Tried that with [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) and a [custom modification](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_lock) last night, and it seems nice so far. 

The delay is a little too long for my liking, still, but I only run into that when pressing Caps Lock to exit insert mode, and immediately saving with :w in Vim.
