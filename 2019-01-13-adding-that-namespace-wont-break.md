@jvanbaarsen@twitter.com Adding that namespace won’t break anything (nothing’s magically hooked up by name), so there’s no reason to advise against it. You’re free to do so, so please keep it if it adds clarity.

However, since you’ll never address the schema modules directly, I’d probably leave them un-namespaced and use the singular schemas and plural contexts convention.
