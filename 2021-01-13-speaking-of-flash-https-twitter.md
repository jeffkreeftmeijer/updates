Speaking of Flash (https://twitter.com/jkreeftmeijer/status/1349055366496219136), I remember attending a one-day Adobe conference, where we were assured Flash (well into its decline by then) would come to the iPhone “any day now”. 

I’m sure both the audience and the speaker knew that was never going to happen.
