@michalbugno@twitter.com Thanks! The original idea was to have more colors left over to use for UI elements like search and diffs (which are still colored), but I havenâ€™t really changed anything there. 

I guess itâ€™s mostly because it looks nice, and I learned I donâ€™t really need actual highlighting. ðŸ¤”
