@schnittchen@mastodon.social Yes, I definitely underuse `--fixup`, and that would probably be the proper way to do it indeed. However, I'm currently grooming an example repository to show clear steps for an article I'm writing, so there's a lot of rebasing going on. I tend to lose track of the fixup commits, and autosquashing them is another step to take.
