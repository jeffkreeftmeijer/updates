@joerebelloharley@tilde.zone Nope, I’ve been dealing with this for a while now. My keyboard and pen tablet are connected to my screen through USB, which is connected to my MacBook through USB-C. 

Every once in a while, my peripherals get disconnected, and I haven’t found a way to fix that aside from rebooting. 🤷‍♂️
