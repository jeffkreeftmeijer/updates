But wait, there’s more! A third option I’m trying is remapping Caps Lock to Escape when pressed, and to Control when held down. You can set that up on macOS by using [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) and downloading a [“complex modification”](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_lock).

Also: yes, I’ve now removed both the Escape and Control keycaps from my keyboard to get used to this.
