@PragTob@twitter.com It is! The finished project, including the `State` module that keeps track of the board’s state, is in the master branch of the starter app’s repository (<https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/hayago/tree/master>). I’d love to know what you think!

Most of the implementation here is illustrative, so I chose a 1D list to keep the code understandable. I came across your article this morning, and using tuples for the board makes a lot of sense. I’ll go over it more thoroughly while working on part 2. Thanks for reaching out!
