@solnic@ruby.social `qq[commands]q` here, because somebody once told me that‘s quickest. Using the `q` registry is probably adding the the confusion, though.

Something [I learned the other day](https://dev.to/phallstrom/comment/7kil) is that you can print and yank macros from and to their registries by using `"ap` and `"ay` (for the `a` registry) so you can see commands printed out. I’m hoping that will help me get a feel for them a bit more.
