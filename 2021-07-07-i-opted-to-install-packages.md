@der_kronn@twitter.com I opted to install packages by hand for now, hoping to reduce the number of installed packages compared to Spacemacs or Doom, but I might check them out in the future. 

@der_kronn@twitter.com Same goes for non-terminal Emacs, really. Iâ€™m quite comfortable in the terminal, and would prefer not to have to configure a GUI to look decent. I might give it a shot later, though. What am I missing? :)
